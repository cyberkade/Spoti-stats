# Spoti-stats

This is a personal project I built utilizing Spotify's API to give a user access to their top 99 artists and songs based on listens. On top of that it allows premium Spotify user's to search and play any song straight from the app; allowing for switching the playback device, adding a song to "Liked Songs", and displaying song lyrics for the playing track.
