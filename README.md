# Spoti-stats

This is a personal project I built utilizing Spotify's API to give a user access to their top 99 artists and songs, based off of listening habits. On top of that it allows premium Spotify users to search and play any song on Spotify, with additional features such as; switching the playback device, adding a song to "Liked Songs", and displaying song lyrics for the currently playing track.
